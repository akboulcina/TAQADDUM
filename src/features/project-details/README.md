# Project Details module

Named export:

```js
import { ProjectDetailsModule } from './features/project-details/ProjectDetailsModule.jsx';
```

Props: `project`, `user`, `onBack`.

The module displays overview, financial, milestone, deliverable, risk, stakeholder and activity sections. Milestone and deliverable updates, as well as follow-up notes, are local demonstration interactions only. If `project` is missing, a graceful empty state with a return action is displayed.
